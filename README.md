Geometry Invaders

I created this in early 2016 as my first personal project. A game inspired by Alien Invaders
with added features such as varied movement patterns from enemies, background animations,
and forcing the user to reload after firing.

It was written in Java using Light Weight Java Game Library (LWJGL) and Javazoom.

To run simply double-click GeometryInvaders.app

Or run the following:

    java -jar GeometryInvaders.jar
